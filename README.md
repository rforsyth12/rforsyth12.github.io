# Projects
Repository for my personal software projects.

Rather than having multiple repositories for small projects, all projects will be contained in this single repository.

Website is available at `http://rforsyth12.github.io/Website`.

## Useful Code
Create a new branch off master: `git checkout -b <name-of-new-branch> origin/master`

Push current branch onto Github, but not master: `git push origin HEAD`
